        <p>
            This screen is a mock-up for the application the end customer, the merchant, is interacting with.<br>
            When the user signs up for a shop using the button below, he will be redirected to another page,<br> 
            where he can log in to the MBO of his shop.<br>
            For the sake of simplicity there is no login mechanism to this page.<br>
            This simple example also assumes that the shop exists already, and ePages is correctly configured<br>
            to allow installation of an app with scope <tt>sso-read</tt> with this shop.<br>
            Of course the ePages hostname will not be supplied by the merchant either.
